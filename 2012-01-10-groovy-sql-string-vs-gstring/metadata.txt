Groovy SQL Metadata tips

Groovy's Sql class contains a number of extremely useful JDBC-related methods.

This blog explains a couple of somewhat obscure features relating to JDBC metadata:
  - String vs GString overloads
  - ResultSetMetadata overloads and column attributes

The Sql class provides several different query methods:
  eachRow()
  firstRow()
  query()
  rows()

Each of these methods provides several overloads.
Where a query takes parameters, the Sql class provides three different approaches:
  Mark the parameters using SQL placeholders "?", and provide parameters in a List.
  For example:
  sql.firstRow("SELECT * FROM offices WHERE officecode = ?", ["

  Mark the parameters using SQL placeholders "?", and provide parameters in an Array. (This can be called with varargs syntax.)
  Use a GString and have Groovy replace GString "${}" placeholders with SQL placeholders.



The overloads occur in pairs, one of which accepts a closure for handling ResultSetMetadata.

So for example,
